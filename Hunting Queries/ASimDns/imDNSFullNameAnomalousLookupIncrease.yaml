name: DNS Full Name anomalous lookup increase
description: |
  'Checking for a threefold increase or more of Full Name lookup per Client IP for the current day for today vs the daily average for the previous week.  
  This can potentially identify excessive traffic to a given location that could be indicative of data transfer out of your network.  
  This is only Name lookups, so it would be recommended to review the Firewall\Webproxy logs in relation to the SrcIpAddr making the interesting requests.'
