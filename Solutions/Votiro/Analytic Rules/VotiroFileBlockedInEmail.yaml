name: Votiro - File Blocked in Email
description: |
 'The analytic rule is designed to identify when a file attachment is blocked in an email due to a Votiro policy. The rule looks for specific indicators in the syslog message, including "Blocked" in the Sanitization Result field, "false" in the Password Protected field, and a non-null value in the From field.
 When these indicators are present, the rule generates an alert that includes details about the blocked attachment, such as the file name and hash, and information about the email, such as the sender and recipient(s). The alert also includes information about the Votiro policy that blocked the attachment and provides a link to additional details about the incident.'
